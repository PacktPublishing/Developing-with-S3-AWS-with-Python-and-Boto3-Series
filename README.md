## About the Video Course
If you want to learn the ins-and-outs of S3 and how to implement solutions with it, this course is for you.
S3 is the Simple Storage Service from AWS and offers many great features you can make use of in your applications and even in your daily life! You can use S3 to host your memories, documents, important files, videos and even your own website!
This course starts by showing you what you need to install and set up on your computer to work with S3. There are two different sections for Windows and MacOS users. These sections are basically identical and show how you can prepare your computer environment to be ready to work with S3! We show you how to install Python and Boto3 and configure your environments for these tools. We also show you how you can create your own AWS account step-by-step and you'll be ready to work with AWS in no time!. When you've finished preparing your environment to work AWS with Python and Boto3, you'll start implementing your own solutions for AWS.
We'll implement our S3 static website hosting from scratch. We'll design a simple website and configure it as a website inside our bucket. Once we have our website up-and-running and accessible via a URL, we'll move on to Route53 to configure our own domain name or DNS to route traffic to our S3-hosted website from our own custom domain!
